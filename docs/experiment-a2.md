# Artifact 2 — Pre-registration

Committed before the simulator, the sweep, or any result exists. The git
timestamp on this file is the evidence that what follows was fixed in advance.

## Question

For an LLM serving deployment whose scale-up lag is a measured cold-start
distribution, does reducing that lag change how much the choice of autoscaling
signal matters?

## Measured inputs, fixed

- Cold-start lag: artifact 1's empirical ECDF, resampled. Arm A (p50 81.1 s,
  n=99 repeat-host) and arm C (p50 39.4 s, n=100 repeat-host). The single
  first-touch run (arm A, 2266.6 s) is excluded: it measures image
  distribution, not a cold start.
- Lag includes `T_platform` (median 4.07-4.83 s). From the autoscaler's point
  of view the wait is the wait.
- Replicas are binary: absent or serving. Justified by artifact 1's
  measurement that `T_fast` is request 1 and per-arm steady-state medians
  differ by 0.6 ms.

## Traffic model, fixed

- `D` sustain = 2 x p95(arm A) = 192.7 s, rounded to **190 s**. Pinned to arm A
  and held constant across both distributions so the composition comparison
  varies exactly one thing.
- `R` ramp = `D`/2 = **95 s**.
- baseline = **40%** of measured saturation.
- `k` = magnitude requiring **3 additional replicas** at the measured service
  rate.

The two absolute rates are computed from the service curve and committed
**before any policy sweep runs**.

## Hypotheses

**H1.** In-flight concurrency dominates the other two on the cost/p99 frontier
for the step spike.

**H2.** GPU utilization is the worst of the three, and the mechanism is
censoring: its frontier degrades most in the high-load region where the signal
has saturated.

**H3 (headline).** The inter-signal frontier gap at iso-cost shrinks by at
least half between the arm-A distribution and the arm-C distribution.

Gap is the p99-damage spread between the best and worst signal at the iso-cost
slice, in seconds. Computed separately for step and ramp, both reported. H3
holds only if the halving occurs under **both** shapes. A halving under one
shape only is published as a partial result, not rounded up to confirmation.

**H4.** The ranking is stable across step and ramp, but margins shrink on the
ramp.

## Analysis plan

Frontiers are compared, not points. The headline sentence comes from the
iso-cost slice. Percentiles reported: p50, p90, p95, p99 of request latency
within a spike. p99 is supported here and was not in artifact 1: a spike
generates thousands of requests, where artifact 1 had ~100 runs per arm.

## Exclusion rules

A simulation run is discarded if the arrival trace is empty, if any replica
never reaches serving before the run ends, or if the policy produces no scaling
action across the entire spike -- each makes the run uninformative about the
signal rather than an observation about it. Discards are counted and reported
by signal, never silently dropped.

## Stopping rule

The sweep is exhaustive over the pre-declared threshold grid; there is no
sequential stopping decision to make. Repetitions per configuration are fixed
at 30 before any result is inspected.
